Welcome! My name is Kyle Montgomery, and I senior studying computer science and mathematics at Washington University in St. Louis. I will graduate in May, 2023. Broadly speaking, my interests include software developement, machine learning, and rock climbing ðŸ§—. I am also a member of WASHUâ€™s NLP group, advised by Prof. Chenguang Wang.

My research is in the area of NLP. Specifically, I'm exploring large pre-trained language models (GPT3, OPT, etc.) for medical code prediction using electronic health records (EHRs) in a zero-shot/few-shot setting.
