Welcome! My name is Kyle Montgomery. I am a second-year PhD student studying computer science at UC Santa Cruz, advised by [Chenguang Wang](https://cgraywang.github.io/). Previously, I completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, as well as a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science, both at Washington University in St. Louis.

My current research focuses on LLM post-training, agentic AI, and scaling test-time compute for hard-to-verify tasks. When not engaging in research, Iâ€™m frequently rock climbing ðŸ§—.
