Welcome! My name is Kyle Montgomery, and I senior studying computer science and mathematics at Washington University in St. Louis. I will graduate in May, 2023. Broadly speaking, my interests include software developement, machine learning, and rock climbing ðŸ§—. I am also a member of WASHUâ€™s NLP group, advised by Prof. Chenguang Wang.

My research lies at the intersection of NLP and computational biology, specifically applying pre-trained language models to predict and model protien structure.
